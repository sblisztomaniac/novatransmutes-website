            <h3>Surrender</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="collapsible-content">
            <p>Life unfolds in its own rhythm, guided by a force far greater than what the mind can grasp. The path to peace lies not in controlling this force, but in surrendering to it — trusting that it knows exactly what it's doing.</p>
            <p>When you let go of the constant need to shape life according to your desires, the struggle begins to fade. The energy within you naturally knows how to heal, guide, and carry you forward.</p>
            <p>This surrender is not about helplessness — it's about balance. Like a sailor adjusting to the wind, you move from one balance point to the next, trusting that you are exactly where you need to be.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="collapsible-content">

                <li>✅ Release the need for control</li>
                <li>✅ Embrace reality as it is</li>

        <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="teaching-subsection">
                <h4>Trust and Let Go</h4>
                <p>"You don't have to control every nerve cell — delegate the authority. As Lao Tzu said:
                'The great Tao flows everywhere, both to the left and to the right. It loves and nourishes all things but does not lord it over them. When merits are accomplished, it lays no claim to them.'</p>
                <p>Relinquishing control and trusting the process paradoxically makes you more powerful. Just as you trust your nervous system to wake you up, you can trust life to unfold beautifully. The key to unity with the universe is not control — it's trust.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="teaching-subsection">
                <h4>Living in the Present</h4>
                <p>The real Self exists for no purpose; it simply <em>is</em>. It doesn't chase the future or cling to the past — it resides in the eternal now. The more you try to make this realization 'useful,' the more elusive it becomes.</p>
                <p>True play is done for no reason — just for fun. Justifying play as 'exercise' or 'good for you' misses its essence. Let go and simply enjoy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="teaching-subsection">
                <h4>Living Authentically</h4>
                <p>If you believe earning money is the most important thing, you risk wasting your life doing what you dislike — just to keep doing things you dislike.</p>
                <p>Human activity often tries to make fleeting joys permanent, yet life's beauty lies in its ever-changing nature. Seeking perfect security in a fluid universe is a contradiction.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="teaching-subsection">
                <h4>On Joy and Peace</h4>
                <p>The secret to enjoying pleasure lies in embracing it without force or fear.</p>
                <p>No amount of effort can turn turmoil into peace.</p>

You are all just like that, and there is nothing wrong with you at all."</em></li>

        <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="teaching-subsection">
                <h4>On Time and Permanence</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Seeking permanence in relationships, love, or peace means pursuing something within time, which does not belong to the timeless.</li>
                    <li>One who sees <em>life totally</em> is beyond time. Such perception is not bound by past conditioning or future anxieties.</li>

                    <li>Misery can be cut immediately, like a surgeon removing an illness. The mind's tendency to delay or analyze suffering only prolongs it.</li>
                    <li>Sorrow ends within sorrow itself—escaping sorrow only prolongs it. Full attention and direct awareness dissolve sorrow instantly, without conflict.</li>

            <div class="teaching-subsection">
                <p>Freud highlighted that repression causes neurosis, but expression alone isn't the cure. Instead, negative emotions should be neutralized and channeled into love, work, and creativity. Simply dumping negativity onto others harms relationships, forcing them to suppress or react, while taking responsibility and processing emotions leads to healthier interactions.</p>
                <p>People often avoid inner struggles through distractions, which can turn into addictions. However, letting go of emotions—without resisting, venting, or judging—leads to immediate physiological and emotional benefits, improving health, perception, and overall well-being.</p>
                <p>Emotions emit energy, shaping our relationships and environment. By surrendering resistance, emotions naturally dissolve, leaving behind peace and clarity.</p>

                <p>"Letting go involves being aware of a feeling, letting it come up, staying with it, and letting it run its course without wanting to make it different or do anything about it."</p>
                <p>"Because emotions emit a vibrational energy field, they affect and determine the people who are in our lives. 'Love promotes love,' so that the person who has let go of inner negativity is surrounded by loving thoughts, loving events, loving people, and loving pets."</p>
                <p>"Just being ordinary is an expression of Divinity; the truth of one's real Self can be discovered in the pathway of everyday life. To live with care and kindness is all that is necessary."</p>

                    <li><strong>Silence is the ultimate reality.</strong> It is not the absence of sound but the absence of mental noise. In true silence, all questions dissolve.</li>
                    <li><strong>You are already free.</strong> The idea that you need to attain something is an illusion. The truth is that you are what you seek.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reality is beyond concepts.</strong> No philosophy, teaching, or belief system can capture the absolute truth—it can only be experienced.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nothing ever happened.</strong> The world, your struggles, your story—these are all projections of the mind. Beyond them, you are untouched.</li>
                    <li><strong>Let go of personal identity.</strong> The ego is a collection of thoughts and memories. It has no real existence, only the power you give it.</li>
                    <li><strong>No need to change the world.</strong> The world exists in your perception. As your perception changes, so does the world.</li>
                    <li><strong>The mind will never find peace.</strong> It is in its nature to create problems. True peace is in the recognition of what is beyond the mind.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stop seeking.</strong> The very act of seeking reinforces the illusion that you are separate from truth. Be still, and it reveals itself.</li>

                <h4>The Lesson of the Hand Pump</h4>
                <p>Between the days of lowering a bucket into a well and the modern electric water pump, there was the hand pump. The hand pump was usually made from cast iron, and you had to pump a handle up and down to get water out of the well.</p>
                <p>The problem with the hand pump was that it had to be <strong>primed</strong> to make it work. Priming involved pouring a little water on the pump to create a seal. Once it was sealed, it was easy to pump up much more water. If you didn't have water in your priming bucket, you had to borrow some from a neighbor.</p>
                <p>It took water to get water. A simple lesson.</p>
                <p><strong>Taoism functions the same way.</strong></p>
                <p>You have to <strong>prime the pump</strong>. You need some spiritual wisdom to get you going.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>A Taoist lifestyle includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A large surplus of <strong>qi</strong></li>
                    <li>Activities like <strong>sleep</strong> to reduce energy costs and restore energy</li>
                    <li>Consuming <strong>high-energy foods</strong></li>
                    <li>A routine with <strong>exercise</strong></li>
                    <li>Physical care that circulates qi</li>
                    <li>Insulation from <strong>outside stressors</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>For thousands of years, Taoists have designed tools to restore your body, mind, and qi. That's why practices like <strong>kung fu</strong>, <strong>qi gong</strong>, and various <strong>health practices</strong> exist — to undo the reckless expenditure of energy during youth.</p>

                <p>However, Taoism teaches that the only thing we can truly do is walk through the <strong>present door</strong> with confidence, knowing the next door will appear as we move forward.</p>
                <p>Many wait for a "big door" that guarantees instant happiness — but this is rare. The real journey lies in passing through one door at a time.</p>

                    "Who can take his own superabundance and therewith serve all under heaven? Only he who is in possession of the Tao!"
                </blockquote>
    
                <h4>On Strength and Weakness</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    "Man at his birth is supple and weak; at his death, firm and strong. (So it is with) all things. Trees and plants, in their early growth, are soft and brittle; at their death, dry and withered."
                </blockquote>
    
                <h4>On the Way of Heaven</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    "It is the way of Heaven not to strive, and yet it skilfully overcomes; not to speak, and yet it is skilful in obtaining a reply; does not call, and yet men come to it of themselves. Its demonstrations are quiet, and yet its plans are skilful and effective. The meshes of the net of Heaven are large; far apart, but letting nothing escape."
                </blockquote>
    
                <h4>On Finishing What You Start</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    "(But) people in their conduct of affairs are constantly ruining them when they are on the eve of success. If they were careful at the end, as (they should be) at the beginning, they would not so ruin them."
                </blockquote>
    
                <h4>On Preparation and Order</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    "Action should be taken before a thing has made its appearance; order should be secured before disorder has begun."
                </blockquote>
    
                <h4>On Great Accomplishments</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    "All difficult things in the world are sure to arise from a previous state in which they were easy, and all great things from one in which they were small. Therefore the sage, while he never does what is great, is able on that account to accomplish the greatest things."
                </blockquote>
    
                <h4>On Choosing What Matters</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    "Or fame or life,<br>
                    Which do you hold more dear?<br>
                    Or life or wealth,<br>
                    To which would you adhere?<br>
                    Keep life and lose those other things."
                </blockquote>
    
                <h4>On Softness and Strength</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    "The softest thing in the world dashes against and overcomes the hardest; that which has no (substantial) existence enters where there is no crevice. I know hereby what advantage belongs to doing nothing (with a purpose)."
                </blockquote>
    
                <h4>On True Mastery</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    "(Those who) possessed in the highest degree those attributes did nothing (with a purpose), and had no need to do anything. (Those who) possessed them in a lower degree were (always) doing, and had need to be so doing."
