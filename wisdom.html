            <div class="teaching-subsection">
                <p>True learning requires a mind free from the burden of accumulated knowledge. In the state of absolute silence, we can truly listen and learn.</p>
                <p>While we spend most of our lives learning to earn a living, we often neglect actual living. School should be a place of leisure where genuine learning happens without pressure.</p>

            <div class="teaching-subsection">
                <p>When intuition speaks, there is no reasoning - it simply feels right. The key is to be present without rushing to answers. This is surrender.</p>
                <p>The mind seeks complexity but truth is simple. You cannot reach simplicity through complexity.</p>

        <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="teaching-subsection">
                <p>The belief that the body needs an "I" to function is a fundamental error. The body operates perfectly well without the conscious "I" and its limited processing capabilities.</p>
                <p>We are not our bodies. Attachment to physical appearance and society's ideals of beauty can create great suffering. True freedom comes from transcending body identification.</p>

                <blockquote>"Everything is determined by forces over which we have no control. We all dance to a mysterious tune, intoned in the distance by an invisible piper." <br>— Albert Einstein</blockquote>
                <p>The realization that we don't have free will is actually liberating. Life becomes easier and more wonderful when we stop believing we're in control.</p>

                <p>A powerful approach to surrender is saying "yes" during meditation, especially in difficult situations. Accept things as they are without resistance.</p>
                <p>Gradually attain stillness through steady practice. Fix the mind in the Self, understanding that "The Self alone is all; there is nothing apart from It."</p>
